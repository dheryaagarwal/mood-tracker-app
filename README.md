# Mood of the Queue

A simple, friendly tool to help your support team log and visualize the emotional ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of incoming tickets‚Äîright in your browser.

## Why We Built This

Every support ticket carries a little bit of emotion‚Äîfrustration when something breaks, joy when everything‚Äôs smooth, or confusion when details are missing. This app does exactly that: log a mood, add a quick note, and watch the bar chart update in near real time.

## How It Works

1. **Google Sheets as a Backend**
   A shared Sheet called `Mood-log` (with columns `timestamp | mood | note`) stores every entry.
   We talk to it via the `gspread` library, authenticating with a Service Account JSON key.
2. **Streamlit Front-End**

   * **Page Config & Auto-Refresh**
     We set up the page layout and use `streamlit_autorefresh` to reload data every N seconds.
   * **Sidebar Controls**
     Let you pick a date range, toggle ‚ÄúGroup by day,‚Äù and adjust the refresh interval.
   * **Mood Form**
     A simple form on the left to submit a new mood + note; writes straight to Google Sheets.
   * **Visualization Panel**
     On the right, we filter and group the data based on your controls, then render a Plotly bar chart.
   * **Raw Data Expander**
     Dive into the full DataFrame right inside the app.
